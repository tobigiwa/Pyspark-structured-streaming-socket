Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance
of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality,
consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as
analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of
security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration,
and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering
lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending
with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.
